# AI-Driven Student Skill Development Platform

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the back end of our AI-Driven Student Skill Development Platform! In this README, I'll walk you through how I handled the back end of this project, which aims to provide a supportive and engaging environment for students interested in advancing their practical skills, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence.

## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the lablab.me hackathon, an exciting event that promotes innovative solutions for education. The platform is designed to facilitate student engagement in clubs focused on artificial intelligence and related technologies, backed by universities. By registering on the platform, students gain access to a wealth of resources and opportunities. The core features and benefits of the platform include:

- **Club Membership**: Students can easily join AI-focused clubs supported by universities.
- **Resource Access**: Registered students can access a wide range of AI-related resources.
- **Project Ideas**: The platform offers carefully curated AI-aligned project ideas for students to work on.
- **Flexible Tracks**: Each club can have multiple branches, allowing students to choose specific tracks such as web development.
- **AI-Generated Tutorials**: Club administrators can request AI-generated tutorials and roadmaps for publication.
- **Project Management**: The platform aids in scheduling and managing project deadlines to instill discipline and time management skills.

## Back End Implementation

I developed the back end of this platform using Flask, a lightweight and versatile Python web framework. Flask allows for quick development and easy integration with various components. The back end primarily focuses on managing user interactions, database operations, and the core functionalities of the platform.

### Technologies Used:

- **Flask**: Chosen for its simplicity and flexibility in building the web application's back end.
- **MySQL**: Used as the database management system to store user data, project details, and other relevant information.

### Front End Technologies:

- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**: The front end of the platform is built using simple HTML for structuring content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for enhancing user interactions. This approach ensures a lightweight and responsive user interface.

### Key Back End Functionalities:

1. **User Management**: Implemented user registration, login, and authentication functionalities to secure user data.
2. **Database Management**: Designed the MySQL database schema to store user profiles, project information, and club details.
3. **Project Idea Handling**: Created endpoints for fetching and submitting project ideas aligned with AI concepts.
4. **Club and Branch Management**: Developed features to create and manage clubs and their branches.
5. **AI-Generated Content**: Integrated AI services to automatically create tutorials and roadmaps requested by club admins.
6. **Project Schedule and Deadlines**: Implemented mechanisms to set project deadlines and manage schedules.
